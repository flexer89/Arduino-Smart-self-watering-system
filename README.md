# Smart self-watering planter based on Arduino

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to create a smart planter that can take care of watering plants on its own, by delivering water in the right amount and at the right time. To build the system, an Arduino module, soil moisture sensors, water pumps, and relays will be used.

## Building process

1.  Prepare the planter base - an appropriately sized planter will be prepared to accommodate the electronic system and plants. Soil moisture sensors will be placed around the plants.
    
2.  Install the Arduino module - the module will be placed in a suitable place on the planter base where it can control the entire system.
    
3.  Install soil moisture sensors - the sensors will be placed in the planter around the plants to monitor soil moisture. When the sensor detects that the soil is too dry, the Arduino module will activate the water pump and deliver the right amount of water to the plants.
    
4.  Connect water pumps - the pumps will be connected to the Arduino module using relays. When the soil moisture sensor detects that the soil is too dry, the Arduino module will send a signal to the relays to activate the pump and deliver the right amount of water to the plants.
    
5.  Program the Arduino module - the Arduino module will be programmed to operate according to the plan. In the program, threshold values of soil moisture will be defined at which the Arduino module should activate the water pump.
    
6.  Test and optimize - after building the system, testing will be conducted to verify that everything works as planned. If necessary, improvements and optimizations will be introduced.
